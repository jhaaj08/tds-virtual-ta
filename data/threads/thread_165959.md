what is the error here?? sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

### 24ds2000024 (2025-02-01)
I have the Same doubt.

[@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) [@21f3002277](/u/21f3002277)
[@24ds2000024](/u/24ds2000024) – please try again after reloading the page.
The new error message will be clearer, like this:

    
    
    Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
    

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can
sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can
sometimes be missing.

### 23f2000237 (2025-02-02)
In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the
evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?

edit: This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this
json might not be in this order tomorrow?

### s.anand (2025-02-02)
[@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237) A good point. Yes, please include _all_ titles.
I’ve reworded the question accordingly. Thanks.

### 23f2000237 (2025-02-03)
I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in
the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?  
(Assuming they have interacted in this thread)

### s.anand (2025-02-03)
Anyone scoring 10/10 on GA4 and replying with a _relevant_ message on this
thread will get 11/10 ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-

### 23f2003853 (2025-02-03)
For me I just made filter of rating between 2 and 7 in site and typed in
console as per video. with that data got in console worked fine.  
copy the coding and save in place use it for data extract when finally submit

### 22f2000113 (2025-02-03)

### nilaychugh (2025-02-04)
how to get the BBC weather API key?

### JoelJeffrey (2025-02-04)
Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full
score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and
would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to
that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

### s.anand (2025-02-04)
[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the
final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the
total.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) can help me to fix the issue

### 23f2000237 (2025-02-04)
Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)  
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any
error

For Q10, I am extracting the text first using PyMuPDF (fitz) and then using
markdownify to convert it to markdown and finally prettier. However despite
trying changing it from PyMuPDF to other text extraction libraries, I end up
getting
